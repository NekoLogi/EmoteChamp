# Installation
1. Download the latest release version.
2. Extract the .jar file into a folder and place it where you want.
3. Run the .jar file (It will generate some files and folders), the .jar will open a browser page that you will need.
4. Copy the link of the browser page, from your searchbar.
5. - Open OBS and create a browser source and put the link into the 'URL' field.
   - Check the 'Control audio via OBS' box.
   - Change the width to 600px and height to something like 1500px. (You can change it later to your preference).
   - Press the 'OK' button to create the source.
6. - Go to you 'Audio Mixer' and press the gear icon.
   - Search for the browser source you created and Change the monitoring mode to 'Monitor and Output' and press 'Close'.

# Adding images and sounds
After launching the .jar file once you will find newly created files and folders these are important for EmoteChamp to work.
Go into the 'assets' folder, you will quickly find, that there is a folder named 'media', that's where you put all your images and sounds into.
## Important notes
+ The name of the image, will also be displayed as the title for the button.
- Sounds will only work when the image and sound filename are the same.
- You need to run the .jar, when you add or remove images/sounds, to refresh the page. (Best practice, just run it once by any changes).
# How use EmoteChamp
It is pretty simple.
1. Go to sources in OBS.
2. Search the browser source and click once on the source.
3. Now you have 2 options:
   - Right-click on the source and press the 'Interact' option.
   - Go to the preview window and press on the pointing-finger icon on the bottom.
Now a window should pop up and you should be able to interact with it.
# Problem solving
### Browser source didn't refresh the new changes.
Try to delete the browser source cache.
1. Go to sources in OBS.
2. Search for your browser source and double click it.
3. After the properties window opened, go down and press the 'Refresh cache of current page' button, the page should be refreshed now.
